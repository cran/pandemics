Description: Full dynamic system to describe and forecast the spread and the severity
    of a developing pandemic, based on available data. These data are number of infections, 
    hospitalizations, deaths and recoveries notified each day. The system consists of three 
    transitions, infection-infection, infection-hospital and hospital-death/recovery. 
    The intensities of these transitions are dynamic and estimated using non-parametric local
    linear estimators. The package can be used to provide forecasts and survival indicators 
    such as the median time spent in hospital and the probability that a patient who has been
    in hospital for a number of days can leave it alive. Methods are described in Gámiz, 
    Mammen, Martínez-Miranda, and Nielsen (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2308.09918> and 
    <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2308.09919>.
